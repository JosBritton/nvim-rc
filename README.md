## Forking

- Rename your lua prefix (`lua/josbritton`) and edit `init.lua` to reference
your own prefix, you may also keep mine in-place as a reference as long as you
modify `init.lua` to include only your relevant config
- You can edit the colors for the included *Juliana* theme under
`./colors/juliana.lua` or install a theme as a plugin and change the theme under
`lua/josbritton/theme.lua`, this will disregard the included Juliana
- Of interest is `lua/josbritton/plugins/lspconfig.lua`, some of the LSPs I use
may not be useful to you or may require dependencies that you don't care to
install, you can disable them there
